Sample Document for Testing

This is a test document to verify that our document processing system works correctly. The document contains multiple paragraphs and different types of content.

Key Points:
1. The system should extract all text from this document
2. The AI should be able to answer questions about this content
3. Users should be able to chat about the document topics

Main Topics Covered:
- Document processing and text extraction
- AI chat functionality with document context
- User interface for file upload and chat

Technical Implementation:
The system uses React Native with Expo for file handling. It processes documents through a custom text extraction utility and stores the content in memory for AI chat sessions.

Conclusion:
This test document should provide enough content for testing the complete document chat workflow from upload to AI interaction.
